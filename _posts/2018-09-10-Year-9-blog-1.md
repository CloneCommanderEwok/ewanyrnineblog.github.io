    <td>I didn't reach my target because I spent so long looking for the template and deleting my repositories that I didnâ€™t have time to do my customization. I was annoyed because this meant lots of hard homework but Mr Keen showed us that W3Schools is a really good website to use as it shows what code you need to make sure everything runs smoothly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on asking my friends for help because I spent a lot of the lesson just looking through different searches for the right template but then I asked someone across the desk and finally got it. Also I need to work faster as I spent a lot of time deleting the wrong templates as I soon found out so that took 10 minutes off my time.
